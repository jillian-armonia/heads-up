# Heads-Up style game
This is a simplified version of the Heads-Up game. It works almost like a flashcard app where you can click a button to put the card back in the pile or take it out.

## How to Use / How to Play
1. Choose a category. The 'example' category are subjects in a normal Japanese junior high school.
2. Choose someone as a guesser. They will stand where they can't see the screen, but everyone else can.
3. The guesser will have a time limit. Everyone in their group can tell them hints.
4. If the word is too difficult, they can choose to `pass`.
5. If they guess the word right, they can `get` the point!
6. Click `reset` to reset the score for the next group or reload the window if there are no more words in the category.
7. Keep playing until you run out of words, categories, or time!

### Notes
- This was designed to be played on an iPad (so dimensions might not be as good on a laptop)
- The score counter is to check how many points the guesser made in that round. Please take note of points on a paper or blackboard.
- Resetting/reloading the window means that the categories will have **ALL** of their cards back in the pile.
